# HomemadeServo  
-This project will involve creating a servo motor, including the mechanical and electrical systems  
-The control system uses a PID controller to correct the angle of the servo based on the desired angle  
-PWM is used to set the angle of the servo 
-The schematics and program for the servo motor are included in this respository
